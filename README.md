# Multitask Training of Small T5 Model for Binary Classification and Similarity

In recent years, transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable success across various natural language processing tasks. Among these, T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) stands out for its versatility and effectiveness. This project delves into the training of a T5 model, specifically the small variant, for multitask prompting, simultaneously addressing binary classification and similarity tasks.

## Objectives

1. **Multitask Learning:**
   - *Binary Classification
   - *Similarity

## Methodology

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - Curating datasets tailored to binary classification and similarity tasks is essential. These datasets will be utilized to train and evaluate the model comprehensively.

2. **Model Training:**
   - The small T5 model will undergo supervised training, employing multitask learning techniques to simultaneously optimize for both binary classification and similarity tasks. The training process will involve careful fine-tuning to strike a balance between the two objectives.

4. **Evaluation and Validation:**
   - Rigorous evaluation metrics, including F1 score and accuracy for binary classification, and correlation coefficients for similarity, will be employed to assess the model's performance. Cross-validation techniques will further validate the model's robustness.
